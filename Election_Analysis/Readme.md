## Election Audit Summary
. With the closing of this election analysis, I recommend the Colorado Board of Elections to continuously develop this Python script to be modified to analyze any future elections. 
A few examples of what could be modified in the future may include:
. The script can be modified by importing the pandas library to improve efficiency.
. The script can also be further developed into an application for various platforms by adding a GUI.
